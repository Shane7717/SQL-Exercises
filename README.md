# :pencil2: SQL-Exercises. :pen:

* This repositoroy is used to record SQL exercises (especially PostgreSQL) which I think are good ones.
* The exercises may come from different sources such as LeetCode and college courses.

Some Notes: <br>
* Common table expressions (CTEs) are a great way to break up complex queries. MySQL started supporting this in version 8.
