## :pencil2: SQL-Exercises. :pen: ##

* This repositoroy is used to record some SQL exercises which I think are good ones.
* The exercises may come from different sources such as LeetCode and college courses etc. 
<br><br>

Some Notes: <br>
* Common table expressions (CTEs) are a great way to break up complex queries. MySQL started supporting this in version 8.
